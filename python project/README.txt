Heyyy it's ya boi NotepadMaster.
	I'm going to start off with the fact that I am no write nor english man just a bumbling old man. I started this project whence I was a little lad nigh a fool. This project was done in failure for I do not know how to teach and I have greatly misoverestimated myself. Anyhow, the story arc goes like this. It all started in a cold afternoon, cold from the AC pumping so much cold air into the building that I was shivering. I was given a project to do with python and thus in my intoxicated state of overconfidence I though what better to teach algorthimns by a python program. 'Genius' I thought at the time not understanding the malbolge I was jumping into. I went in eager believing that maybe I could teach algorthims humanely but alas I realize now that this is a nigh impossible goal. That the best method of teaching oneself algorthims is to play around with the algorthims or implementing in "YOUR" version of the algorthim and understanding the ins and outs of how the algortihm runs. It may seem weird it may seem cluncky, malbolge! it may even seem inefficient but remember you should not optimize the code before you can even make it. Baby steps to start making algorthims in your own words before trying to optimize it. Anyhow This project started by putting my few drops of wisdom of how algorthims works. It may never be found until the end of time but there are just MY understanding of algorithm I may come back and revisit to *fix* some of these but that is for another time. 
	Anyhow time to get serious this project was created to show how sorting algorthims work I wanted the user to see beyond the ofsucation of code and see how the process was going on inside the hood of this machine. Alas I bit off more that I could chew and it ended in failure. This mess of makes me seem like a bumbling old fool trying to understand something god has not intended for me to understand. I have bitten off more that I could chew and also the fact that I could not understand how to teach it in an efficient manner has... plagued me. This mess of sleep() and print has me confused. I orginally started the easier but inefficient 'bubble sort' which was very inefficient in my version for I could have saved lg(n) time if I used max or min heapify for that is the most efficient way to get either the largest or smallest number of an array. But I was too busy and I shoveled on programming more nonsense. I made insertionsort which in my opinion I did not explain too well. Then I worked on quicksort which took the longest time for I came upon the problem of pivot stuckage. Where if there was a duplication it caused problems where the pivot just kept on switching hence the loop would keep going until python just gave up living. I also used a recursive method hence it kept on going on and on for the exit condition was 'when the length of the array pulled out from the greater array exit' but this pivot duplication problem occured. Thus in my Grand wisdom I made it that if there was an element similar to the pivot it would both put them into this pivot array (array containing pivots) then call a for loop putting only one instance of the pivot at a time. Then it all came together and I was going to tackle mergesort but then other classes came in and stole this project of its much needed time and when I came back I was going to do a simple merge sort where I insertion sort two halves of an array then merge it together but I never did. Why? School. Anyhow realizing I wasted a whole week because winter blues and sleep deprivation was starting to wear me down. I did a gamble and prayed this was going to pop up in the final assesment (which it did) and it payed off. I played with an old mistress regex and all of her scary but beautiful methods. I implemented regex so that it would get JUST all the valid numbers typed by the user. Where each element is seperated by spaces or newlines. Hence it accepts a string with a bunch of numbers with spaces to signigy a new element. Any charaters or punctuations... I take that back punctuations does sepreate. Your boy a fool and pathetic.  Anyhow I used regex uuhmnnmmmm didn't think of punctuations but hey it gets numbers from users? This we are her at the end where the only take away from this is that I should NEVER teach, I actually learned more of sorting algorthims from this than my professors, and that I am still a fool.
	I never mentioned the original goal. The original goal of this was to teach sorting algorthims as humanely as possible without all the BS math and jargon they throw out like they are some financial advisor. I did not want people going head first only to get taught what fear is and realize that your understanding of algorthims is nothing and will be nothing. I wanted there to be a way to help visualize the algorthim instead of by code and understanding how the code works and how the algorthim is performed by that code rather than to make them suffer by seeing some 1 minute clip of how the sorting algortihm works and having a false sense of security beliving you understand something when in reality you know nothing but a SMOL sliver of the subject at hand and if told to write the algorthim you would collapse and fail like how I have done. I wanted there to be a tool to visualize algorthims but I think it ended in failure. Though to be honest here graphing (nodes and edges and saddness) was what I really struggled with but to work with that... I would need a visual library and well... I am lazy and kind of stupid too. These are my reasons and experiences of working with this project. May those that come after be blessed by better luck than me. I hope others can gleams something from this mess. Anyhow have a nice day.
